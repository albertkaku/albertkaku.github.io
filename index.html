      <h2>Trends in Adult Education</h2>
      <p><h3>Post #1 Trends</h3>
        We've talked about these two trends: game-based learning and duty to
accommodate. They both introduced by the internet. The first one becomes a 
trend because internet push information to everyone in all different forms.
Students focus time got dramatically shrinked. As instructors, we need to 
arrange more game-like activities to draw our learners' attention to reach 
better learning result and outcomes. The second one is also because of internet,
which made info/resources become much more easier to accessible, as instructors,
our main duty is no longer present knowledge to our learners. They can find
everything they need online. Our main duty become more and more about to
accommandate learners' need to maintain their focus.
      </p>
      <p><h3>Post #2 Impact</h3>
       1) Game-based learning trend will impact the classroom activities.<br/>
      For old fasion, an instructor comes to the class, starts lecturing,<br/>
      then practice time which is followed by quiz, review and exam.<br/>
      For this game-based learning trend, we need to design the course differently,<br/>
      because that the center of a class is students, no longer the instructor.<br/>
      We need to design different lab activities and games to draw learners' attention.<br/><br/>
       2) Duty to accommodate, is another important and interesting trend.<br/>
      Since information and knowledge get closer and closer to learners, through internet,<br/>
      mobile devices, learning is no longer one direction process. In old days, <br/>instructors
      output their knowledge along with their understanding and experiences to learners.<br/>
      Learners simply just recieves and then responses. However, along with the trend,<br/>
      Learners become the center of the learning process, they take on the responsibilities<br/>
      which is good in a sense of self-motivated way. Instructors' role become less and less<br/>
      accommating, rather than dominated role.

      <p><h3>Post #3 "Aha moments"</h3>
       The program I'm teaching in BCIT is using flipping classroom. At beginning, <br/>
       I didn't know how it's different from assigning weekly reading materials.<br/>
       I thought it's just assigning homework ahead of the class. After learning this course,<br/>
       things start make sense to me, like how other instructors have so many activities<br/>
       during the class time, and students get better outcome from those, even if some <br/>
       of the sessions do not actually have lecturing parts. Because they are playing the role<br/>
       of facilitator to accommandate, instead of ongly deliverying contents from one direction.
